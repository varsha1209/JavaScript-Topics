Call  - The call method is used to invoke a function and allows you to set the this value explicitly. It accepts the this value as the first argument, followed by arguments passed to the function one by one.

Apply - The apply method is similar to call, but it accepts arguments as an array.

Bind - The bind method creates a new function with a specified this value and, optionally, initial arguments. It does not immediately execute the function but returns a new function with the provided context.
