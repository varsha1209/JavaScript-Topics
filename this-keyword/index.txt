This inside a function
Normally it targets the window object.
In it, this points to the owner of the function call, I repeat, THE FUNCTION CALL, and NOT the function itself. The same function can have different owners in different scenarios.

**What about Arrow Functions? **
It takes it's this from the outer “normal” function, this won't make much sense now, since as you can see it’s also pointing to window object.
